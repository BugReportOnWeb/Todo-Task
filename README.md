## Description

Todo Task is a task management application built using the popular [React](http://reactjs.org/) framework, designed to deliver a seamless and intuitive user experience.

* The app currently operates as a complete static web application. It may soon be updated with backend functionality to store previous tasks even after a page refresh.
* The goal in creating this app was to deepen the understanding of front-end development, specifically with the React library.
* Throughout the process, I gained invaluable insights into developing a CRUD-like application using a UI framework.

## Installation/Usage

If you want to test and try the app on your own, here are the steps you can follow:

* Clone the repository to a desired destination and head inside the same.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/BugReportOnWeb/todo-task.git
$ cd todo-task
```

* Install the dependencies and start the development server.
```bash
$ npm install 
$ npm run dev 
```

If you encounter any errors, refer to the error message for guidance on how to correct the issue. Below are a few common mistakes:
* Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. If you don't have it installed, download and install it from the official [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) website.
* Check that you have cloned the correct repository and that you are in the correct directory when running the installation and development commands.
* Make sure that you have internet connectivity so that npm can download the required packages and dependencies.
